# Verify Vending Machine
Now that we've decomposed our initial JavaScript file into three separate, self-contained classes, we should finally test the remaining methods that act as the entry points into these classes' functionality. In practice, you should always delegate specific functionality to its own service and have a controller like ```vendingMachine.js``` orchestrate all the work that these services do. Is it good practice to have all code that are related to each other in a new file so that is easy to navigate through. Once you separate the different methods, create one file that connects all of them together just like the ```vendingMachine.js```.

After creating separate files that contain the different methods, run all of the tests and check if the methods properly work. If all of the methods run smoothly and connect with the final controller, the only thing you should have to do in this exercise is replace any ```this``` references with references to the classes that call the methods.

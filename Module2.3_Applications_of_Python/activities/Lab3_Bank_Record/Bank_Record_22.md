Since we don't know how many entries may be in the dictionary at any time, we need to find an iterative approach to print all the entries. A **for loop** would greatly help. To extract the values of the dictionary, keep in mind it is a **list**. After indexing the dictionary, we have to index the list that is returned when we indexed the dictionary.

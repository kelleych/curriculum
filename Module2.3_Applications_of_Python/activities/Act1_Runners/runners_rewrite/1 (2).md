We are going to finish writing a program for 5 runners that ran a sponsor race. Their data is in the program already, and we have to calculate their cash prizes based on their ranking and titles received.

Ranking: Each runner is associated with a finish time for their race and were assigned a rank based on how fast they ran (rank 1 was the fastest, while rank 5 was the slowest).

* Rank 1 awards $100
* Rank 2 awards half the amount of cash of Rank1
* Rank 3 awards one-third the amount of cash of Rank 1

Titles: Each runner may qualify for a title that awards them additional prize money.

* Each title is worth $20 additive to the amount of cash earned from ranking
* "Pass" - Runner ran faster than or equal to a 60 seconds; they satisfy the sponsor's expectations. This title is required to receive any cash
* "Golden" - The fastest runner receives this title
* "On the dot" - Runners whose time ended on a second (i.e 45.00 seconds, 37.00 seconds, 57.00 seconds, but not 43.10 seconds because of the .1 seconds)

We store the runners' data as a **dictionary** inside a variable called `runners`, which is passed into all the other functions as an argument. 

```python
runners = {
        1 : ["Bruce", 27.24, ["Pass"]],
        2 : ["Hugo", 32.00, ["Pass"]],
        3 : ["Tony", 44.00, []],
        4 : ["Jay", 57.73, []],
        5 : ["Donovan", 75.75, []],
    }
```



The players' titles are already in there from last year's data.

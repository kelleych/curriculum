#Specifications

As a reminder, here are the rules pertaining to the money prize:

- 1st place gets $100
- 2nd place gets half of $100
- 3rd place gets a third of $100
- Each title is worth $20 only if they have the title "Pass"
- The "Pass" title is not worth any money

#Using Containers to store info

We should first tackle what is common amongst all contestants, which is the cash prizes for the titles. But first, we need to declare a **dictionary** for mapping the cash to the runner's name. It would also be useful to have a **list** of all the runner's names, so we can reference them quicker.

```python
cashPrizes = {}
names = ["Bruce", "Hugo", "Tony", "Jay", "Donovan"]
```

#Assigning through indexing

Starting with a **for loop** from 1 to 5 for each runner, we can see that to reach the title data of each runner, we need to first index the **dictionary** by the runner number, then index it again by the second index (to get the third element)

```python
# assign cash for titles
for i in range(1,6):
    runnerTitles = runners[i][2]
```

To get the right name for each iteration, we need to subtract by one, since 0 is the first index for `names` while the for loop starts at 1. To subtract, we use the **numerical operator** the minus sign `-`. It subtracts the number on its left with its right and returns the result. When we have `i - 1`, and `i` is 5, then `5 - 1` becomes `4`, so we are **indexing** at 4.

```python
# assign cash for titles
for i in range(1,6):
    runnerTitles = runners[i][2]
    name = names[i - 1]
```

Now, to receive money for titles, we need to check if "Pass" is already in the runner's titles `runnerTitles`

```python
if ("Pass" in runnerTitles):
```

However, we also need only assign money for titles other than "Pass". We can check the amount of titles by checking the length of the `runnerTitles` **list**. We need to subtract that length by 1 to remove counting the "Pass" title, since it is a title, too. If **True**, then we need to multiply the length by 20, since each title is worth $20. Multiplication is another **numerical operator** and works like subtraction.

```python
if ("Pass" in runnerTitles and len(runnerTitles) > 1):
	cashPrizes[name] = (len(runnerTitles) - 1) * 20
```

#Calculating the cash prizes 

Now we need to calculate the cash for ranking. We can use another **for loop** for only runners 1 to 3 this time, since 4 and 5 don't get any for ranking.

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
```

We need to obtain the name the same way, again.

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    name = names[i - 1]
```

If you look at the cash amounts, each consecutive place decreases by a fraction of 100, or `100 / i`, so we can add this much to the cash earned from the titles.

**Note**: Since we are adding and dividing, Python automatically understands that the division (or multiplication) occurs first, so we need to add parentheses around the addition, so the addition gets done first.

```python
# assign cash for rank
for i in range(1, 4):
    name = names[i - 1]
    cashPrizes[name] = (cashPrizes[name] + 100) / i
```

To check the cash values of each runner, we can print out `cashPrizes`. It's a dictionary, so `items()` can get us both the keys (names) and values (cash).

#The Finished Product:

```python
def assignCashPrizes(runners):
    ''' 1st place gets $100
        2nd place gets $50
        3rd place gets $33

        Each title is worth $20 only if they have the title "Pass"
        the "Pass" title is not worth any money
    '''
    cashPrizes = {}
    names = ["Bruce", "Hugo", "Tony", "Jay", "Donovan"]

    # assign cash for titles
    for i in range(1,6):
        runnerTitles = runners[i][2]
        name = names[i - 1]
        if ("Pass" in runnerTitles and len(runnerTitles) > 1):
            cashPrizes[name] = (len(runnerTitles) - 1) * 20

    # assign cash for rank
    for i in range(1, 4):
        name = names[i - 1]
        cashPrizes[name] += 100 / i

    # print results
    for name, cash in cashPrizes.items():
        print(name + " won $" + "{:.2f}".format(cash))
    
def assignTitles(runners):
    ''' Assigns titles for meeting certain requirements
        "Golden" == Time is the fastest among contestants
        "Pass" == Time is less than minute
        "On the dot" == Time is exactly on a second like 54.00
        "Fail" == Time is longer than a minute or does not have "Pass"
        Runners who've received a title last time may not receive it again
    '''

    runners[1][2].append("Golden")
    
    for num, runnerData in runners.items():
        name, time = runnerData[0:2]

        # "Pass" title
        title = "Pass"
        if (time < 60 and title not in runnerData[2]):
            runnerData[2].append(title)

        # "Fail" title
        title = "Fail"
        if (time >= 60 or "Pass" not in runnerData[2]):
            runnerData[2].append(title)
            
        # "On the dot" title
        title = "On the dot"
        if (time % 1 == 0):
            runnerData[2].append(title)

            
```

We have to write `main()` now.

We only have to update the titles and cash prizes of the runners, so we can simply just call two functions in charge of that.

```python
def main():
    runners = {
        1 : ["Bruce", 27.24, ["Pass"]],
        2 : ["Hugo", 32.00, ["Pass"]],
        3 : ["Tony", 44.00, []],
        4 : ["Jay", 57.73, []],
        5 : ["Donovan", 75.75, []],
    }

    assignTitles(runners)
    assignCashPrizes(runners)
    
```
